# (EA) Solace Event Portal Designer MCP Server

The Event Portal MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server is designed to revolutionize how developers interact with event-driven architecture by bringing Event Portal’s comprehensive EDA design capabilities directly into AI-assisted IDEs like Claude Code. This powerful integration tool bridges the gap between Event Portal’s rich event management features and modern development workflows, enabling developers to seamlessly access, create, and manipulate EDA assets through natural language conversations without leaving their preferred development environment. 

Whether you’re developing applications already designed in Event Portal or creating new event-driven architectures from scratch, this Early Access MCP server allows you to retrieve design information including produced/consumed events and schemas, access AsyncAPI specifications, generate application code, and even create new application versions in Event Portal Designer—all through simple chat interfaces in your IDE. 

By meeting developers where they are and eliminating context switching between tools, the Event Portal MCP Server aims to streamline the entire event-driven application development lifecycle from design to implementation.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** - Required to run the MCP server (includes `pip3`)
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** - Required if using `uvx` in your MCP client configuration (recommended). Not needed if using pip installation method.
- **MCP Client** - Such as [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline)
- **Solace Cloud Account** - With access to Event Portal. [Sign up for free](https://console.solace.cloud/login/new-account)

## Quick Start

1. **Get an API Token** from the [Cloud Console](https://console.solace.cloud/). Ensure the token has **"Event Portal > Designer > Read"** permissions (and appropriate write permissions if you need to create/modify objects).

2. **Add to your MCP client configuration** (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cline):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "solace-event-portal-designer": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "solace-event-portal-designer-mcp",
        "solace-ep-designer-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SOLACE_API_TOKEN": "<your-api-token>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Restart your MCP client** and start asking questions about Event Portal.

**Example prompts:**
- "List all application domains in my Event Portal"
- "Show me events in the OrderManagement domain"

## Usage Guidelines

This MCP server is intended for use with AI assistants (such as Claude Desktop or Cline) in a controlled environment with human oversight. It is not designed for automated workflows like GitHub Actions or unattended automation systems.

When using this tool, you share responsibility for the data privacy of your Solace Cloud data. Use API tokens with appropriate permissions and follow your organization's security policies.

## Installation

### Recommended: No installation needed

If you use `uvx` in your MCP client configuration (as shown above), the package will be automatically downloaded when your client starts.

### Alternative: Pre-install with pip

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install solace-event-portal-designer-mcp

# Or install from Git
pip install git+https://github.com/SolaceLabs/solace-platform-mcp.git#subdirectory=solace-event-portal-designer-mcp
```

Use this option if your MCP client doesn't support `uvx` or you prefer pre-installing. Then use `"command": "solace-ep-designer-mcp"` in your configuration instead of `uvx`.

## Configuration

### Multi-Region Support

By default, the server connects to the US region. If your Solace Cloud account is in a different region, set the `SOLACE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in your MCP client configuration:

| Region | Base URL |
|--------|----------|
| United States (default) | `https://api.solace.cloud` |
| Australia | `https://api.solacecloud.com.au` |
| Europe | `https://api.solacecloud.eu` |
| Singapore | `https://api.solacecloud.sg` |

**Example configuration for Australia:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "solace-event-portal-designer": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "solace-event-portal-designer-mcp",
        "solace-ep-designer-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SOLACE_API_TOKEN": "<your-token>",
        "SOLACE_API_BASE_URL": "https://api.solacecloud.com.au"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SOLACE_API_TOKEN` | Yes | - | Your Solace API token |
| `SOLACE_API_BASE_URL` | No | `https://api.solace.cloud` | Base URL for Solace Cloud API |

See [Managing your API Tokens](https://docs.solace.com/Cloud/ght_api_tokens.htm) and [Authentication](https://api.solace.dev/cloud/reference/authentication) for details on creating a token. Ensure the API Token has at least "Event Portal > Designer > Read" permissions.

## Available Tools

This server provides a comprehensive set of tools for full CRUD operations on Solace Event Portal Designer objects:

- **Application Domains** - Create, read, update, delete, and list domains
- **Applications** - Manage applications and their versions
- **Events** - Manage events and their versions
- **Schemas** - Manage schemas and their versions
- **AsyncAPI Export** - Generate AsyncAPI specifications from application versions

### Example Usage

Use your AI assistant to:
- "List all events in my application domain"
- "Create a new schema for order events"
- "Export an AsyncAPI spec for application version X"
- "Show me all applications that publish the OrderCreated event"

## Troubleshooting

### Verify your setup is working

After configuring your MCP client, verify the connection:

1. **Restart your MCP client** (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cline)
2. **Ask a simple question** like: "List my application domains"
3. If it works, you'll see results from Event Portal

### Common Issues

**"API token not found" or authentication errors:**
- Ensure `SOLACE_API_TOKEN` is set correctly in your MCP client configuration
- Verify your token hasn't expired in the [Cloud Console](https://console.solace.cloud/)
- Check the token has appropriate permissions

**"Connection refused" or timeout errors:**
- Check if you're using the correct region via `SOLACE_API_BASE_URL` (see [Multi-Region Support](https://github.com/SolaceLabs/solace-platform-mcp/tree/main/solace-event-portal-designer-mcp#multi-region-support))
- Verify your network allows connections to `api.solace.cloud` (or your region's URL)

**"Command not found" errors:**
- Verify you have the [prerequisites](https://github.com/SolaceLabs/solace-platform-mcp/tree/main/solace-event-portal-designer-mcp#prerequisites) installed
- If using pip install, run `which solace-ep-designer-mcp` to verify installation
